basketball
==========

I do a little bit of dabbling in sports analysis, and this repo will contain my
basketball-related code, such as the following:

domain - Domain-specific objects for parsing game logs.
heatmapper-core - Core system for plotting shooting heat maps.
heatmapper-runner - (unfinished) command-line tool for invoking heatmapper.
